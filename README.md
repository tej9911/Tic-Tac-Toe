# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python

A simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python.

## Features

- Two-player turn-based gameplay.
- Displays the board dynamically after each move.
- Ensures valid moves (prevents overwriting occupied spaces).
- Simple and interactive UI.

## How to Play

1. Run the script using Python.
2. Players take turns choosing a position (1-9) to place their mark.
3. The game updates the board accordingly.
4. The first player to get three in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins!

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-python.git
   cd tic-tac-toe-python

 ## Future Improvements
  1. Add a win-checking feature.
  2. Implement AI for single-player mode.
  3. Create a GUI version with Tkinter or Pygame.
